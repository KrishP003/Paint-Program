# Paint-Program

The Paint Program is a user-friendly application that offers a simplified recreation of the popular Windows Paint program. It provides users with a range of tools and features to create and edit digital artwork effortlessly.

The program offers various shape options such as rectangles, circles, lines, and freehand drawing. Users can easily switch between these shapes to suit their artistic needs. Additionally, a diverse color palette is available, including premade swatches for quick selection. For more precise color customization, users can create custom colors using the HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value), HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness), RGB (Red, Green, Blue), and CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black) color models.

To control the thickness of the paint brush, the program provides a convenient scroller. Users can adjust the brush size according to their preferences, allowing for fine details or broader strokes.

Saving and loading work is made easy in the Paint Program. Users can save their creations as files and access them later to continue editing. This feature ensures that no progress is lost and provides the flexibility to refine artwork over multiple sessions.
